## Starting server
Run `ng serve -o` to start a dev server and open it in the browser. The server is hosted on `http://localhost:4200/`. The server will automatically reload when changes are made.

## Making a new page (maybe?)
Run `ng generate component <pagename>` to automatically create multiple files in the app folder (which is used for the new page). `component` can be replaced with any of the following terms: `directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`
