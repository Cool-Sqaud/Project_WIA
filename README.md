## Starting server
Run `ng serve` to start a dev server. This server is hosted on `http://localhost:4200/`.\

The server will automatically reload when changes are made.

Run `ng generate component <pagename>` to automatically create multiple files in the app folder (which is used for the new page).\
`component` can be replaced with any of the following terms: `directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`
